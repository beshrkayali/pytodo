How pytodo works?
=================

pytodo searchs for comment lines that start with "# TODO" in your selected scripts. These lines will be added to the TODO file with information on where they exist.
pytodo uses a settings file (pytodo_settings.py) so it can be easier to regenerate the TODO file.

	How it works?
	================
	  * cd to your project
	  * run:
	  	python pytodo.py --init
	  	[this will create pytodo_settings.py]
	  	open it and add your scripts to scripts_tuple, this'll make pytodo process these scripts searching for todos
	  * set projec_name, extra_header, extra_footer in pytodo_settings
	  * run:
	  	python pytodo.py --generate
	  * done :)
